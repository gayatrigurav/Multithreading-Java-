		//Executing several tasks simultaneously called concept of multitasking.
		//there are two types of multitasking
		//1.ProcessBased multitasking and 2.thread based multitasking
		
		//Process based multitasking :Executing several tasks simultaneously where every task is 
		//separate independent program(process) is called process based multitasking..OS level multitasking
		//e.g while typing java program we can listen music from same system at the same time we can download a file 
		//net all these tasks will be executed simultaneously and independent of each other.
		
		//Thread based multitasking: Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent 
		//part of the same program is called as thread based multitasking.
		
		//objective of multitasking is to reduce response time of system to improve performance.
